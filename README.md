# AdventuresTracked
AdventuresTracked is a trip tracking web app where users can view the trips that they have taken and various details about the trip. Currently, a user can see the amount of miles traveled that trip, the legs taken that trip with the miles traveled per leg, and any journals taken on the trip. A user can register to make an account and login to see personal trips. This web app was built using a .NET Web API backend, a React JS frontend, and a SQL Server database.
